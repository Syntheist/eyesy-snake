## eyesy-snake

**An [Eyesy](https://www.critterandguitari.com/eyesy) "mode" that makes a snake move to the beat.**

Snake will move according to its surroundings when sound threshold is high enough, and it has been at least the time designated buy the "tempo gate" (knob 1)

Some gross global variable initiation but it seems like Eyesy docs want that idk whatever
